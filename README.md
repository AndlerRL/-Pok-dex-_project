<h1>'Pokédex'_project</h1>

<h5><code>v1.3.1b</code></h5>

<p><strong>CSS Modules!</strong> I really like to use CSS Modules, so it has been added to the project and all files have already had that reference on the imports and code (of course).</p>

<h5><code>v1.3.1a</code></h5>

<p>Decided to update this webApp with React 16.8.4, using AXIOS respectively for the gets of the Pokemon API.</p>

<p>I started already to separate the whole project into differents files, paths and using a re-usable structure for this framework.</p>

<h5><code>v1.0.0</code><h5>

<p>A simple project that demostrate the use of Fetch API alone with ES6. This project execute a list of pokémons, exactly <code>100 species of pokémon</code> that has a card designed details section once you click on the pokémon img.</p>

<ol>
  <strong>There is also 2 details:</strong>
  <li>
    It can be run on: <code>Xampp (Apache), Python 3.7 (<strong>python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]</strong> executed on main  folder) & by clicking on index.html</code>
  </li>
  <li>By CORS security standars, on code I couldn't resolve the header req, so I installed <code> Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> plugin on chrome and also mozilla firefox (dev & regular edition) in order to be running.</li>
</ol>

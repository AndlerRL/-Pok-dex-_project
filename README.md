<h1>'Pokédex'_project</h1>

<h4><code>v1.5.20</code></h4>

<p><strong>Bug fixed!</strong> Now the pokemon card list populates properly acordding the pokemon and evolution as his API has it. Added a JS Library, underscore.js for the sorting list and id! Now we can appreciate the right order with, the pokemon img and info.</p>

<h3><code>v1.5.12</code></h3>

<p>UI design changes on Pokemon card; Colorful and more styled.</p>

<strong>Working on bugs:</strong>
<p>Sorting the list! I still have some bugs with the main pokemon list, still pokemon images does not render according the name on the card; working on it (Charizard disguise as Raticate, haha).</p>

<h3><code>v1.5.0</code></h3>

<p>Pokemon card UI has been changed and some rendering has been completed, such as the Modal with the pokedex and re-structured (again) the files within the project.</p>

<p>At this moment I am working on the pokedex UI/UX and bugs; filters and search bar still pending.</p>

<strong>Working on bugs:</strong>

<p>There is clearly a list of pokemons but pokemons img are not appropiate to the pokemon card; working on it with the Axios.get() and rendering.</p>

<h3><code>v1.4.5</code></h3>

<p>There was a collission between the main content and Filters sections; it has been fixed.</p>

<strong>Working on bugs:</strong>

<p>There is an issue at the time to iterate all pokemons on the main section, but I'm fixing it through time to time, due nature complexibility of the Pokemon API.</p>

<h3><code>v1.4.0</code></h3>

<p>Made a mockup for the design and structure of this webapp. I decided to made a whole new UI/UX for the next version of my project. It has many areas, and, analytics (me, haha) is deciding if to add or remove some components/containers to the webapp. Right now it's just design and SOME interactions. Hope you like it.</p>

<h3><code>v1.3.7a</code></h3>

<p>Basic pokédex render has been made and some other changes, such:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paths & files has been re-structured to make more sense on the project.</li>
<li>There is one Pokémon rendering, but only for UI reference.</li>
</ul>

<h3><code>v1.3.1b</code></h3>

<p><strong>CSS Modules!</strong> I really like to use CSS Modules, so it has been added to the project and all files have already had that reference on the imports and code (of course).</p>

<h3><code>v1.3.1a</code></h3>

<p>Decided to update this webApp with React 16.8.4, using AXIOS respectively for the gets of the Pokemon API.</p>

<p>I started already to separate the whole project into differents files, paths and using a re-usable structure for this framework.</p>

<h3><code>v1.0.0</code><h3>

<p>A simple project that demostrate the use of Fetch API alone with ES6. This project execute a list of pokémons, exactly <code>100 species of pokémon</code> that has a card designed details section once you click on the pokémon img.</p>

<ol>
  <strong>There is also 2 details:</strong>
  <li>
    It can be run on: <code>Xampp (Apache), Python 3.7 (<strong>python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]</strong> executed on main  folder) & by clicking on index.html</code>
  </li>
  <li>By CORS security standars, on code I couldn't resolve the header req, so I installed <code> Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> plugin on chrome and also mozilla firefox (dev & regular edition) in order to be running.</li>
</ol>
